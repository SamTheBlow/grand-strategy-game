extends OptionButton
## When the user selects an item from this button's options, shows the
## Control nodes associated with that item, and hides all the other ones.
## Hides all of the option nodes when this node is hidden.

## Effectively an Array[Array[Control]].
## Associates an array of Control nodes to each OptionButton option.
## Make sure to put the filters in the same order as the OptionButton options!
##
## For example, [[oak_node, birch_node], [apple_node, banana_node], [fish_node]]
## would show the tree nodes when the first option is selected,
## the food nodes for the second option, and the animal nodes for the third.
