## Synchronizes a given instance of [GameRules] between network clients.

## See also: [GameSelectMenuSync]

## Emitted on clients when the client receives a new state from the server,
## in which case this signal will pass a new instance of [GameRules].
## Also emitted on clients when the client disconnects from a server,
## in which case this signal will pass a reference to the user's local state.
